I code website backends in Python, using Django.\r\nI have 2 years of experience in that.\r\nApart from programming sites in Django, I am also fairly well experienced in\r\ncomputer vision with OpenCV and Python.\r\n\r\n## My works:\r\nI spent most of my time in [CodeMyMobile](http://www.codemymobile.com)\r\nAll the projects except for the last one, were client projects during my stay\r\nat CodeMyMobile.\r\n* [Bookwithbit](http://bookwithbit.com)\r\n* [CoSign](http://cosign.co)\r\n* [CoSign for Publishers](http://publishers.cosign.co)\r\n* [Friendly Deals](http://friendlydealsapp.com)\r\n* ITSigma (client sold it, don't know where it's hosted now)\r\n* [GetMeAShop](http://www.getmeashop.com/) - the awesome place I'm working at right now.\r\nNote: Links of some the projects (except GetMeAShop) may not work, because it\r\ncould be that the clients took them down.\r\n\r\n## More about me:\r\nI love Python. Python is life, Python is love. This love story started in late 2011, when I for the first\r\ntime saw a guy open up his laptop's webcam programmatically with OpenCV and Python.\r\nThat was just... magic! I had seen Python code before that, but really hadn't seen why I'd\r\nprefer it over C++ or Java.\r\nHad it not been for the love I found for Python in 2011, I'd probably be bashing away some\r\nJava madly at some stupid MNC. Thankfully, I'm not in that position, and I am very much grateful\r\nthat I write Python code daily to earn bucks.\r\n\r\nApart from programming, I ... <coming soon>",
