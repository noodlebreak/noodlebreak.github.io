        <p>Hi! I'm Ashish, and this is my website, which is currently hosted on github pages.</p>

        <a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a programmer by profession. I code website backends in Python, using Django.
          I have 2 years of experience in that.
          Apart from programming sites in Django, I am also fairly well experienced in
        computer vision with OpenCV and Python.</p>

        <p>I spent most of my time in <a href="http://www.codemymobile.com">CodeMyMobile</a>
        All the projects except for the last one, were client projects during my stay
      at CodeMyMobile.</p>

        <li><a href="http://bookwithbit.com">Bookwithbit</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://cosign.co">CoSign</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://friendlydealsapp.com">Friendly Deals</a></li>
        <li>ITSigma (client sold it, don't know where it's hosted now)</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.getmeashop.com/">GetMeAShop</a> - the awesome place I'm working at right now.
          Note: Links of some the projects (except GetMeAShop) may not work, because it
        could be that the clients took them down.</li>

      <a id="more-about-me" class="anchor" href="#more-about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More about me:</h2>
      <p>I love Python. Python is life, Python is love. This love story started in late 2011, when I for the first
        time saw a guy open up his laptop's webcam programmatically with OpenCV and Python.
        That was just... magic! I had seen Python code before that, but really hadn't seen why I'd
        prefer it over C++ or Java.
      Had it not been for the love I found for Python in 2011, I'd probably be developing Android apps in Java or doing backend development in Java at an MNC, which is cool too, except that Java is too much of a verbose language for me, if developer friendliness and a short product POC ETA is preferred.</p>
      <p>
        In the future though, I'm planning out things to implement in Go lang, so that's an area I'd love to explore in future jobs or endeavours of mine. Currently out of the 8 projects that I've built myself for myself, 3 of which were to be businesses, are all written in Python (with the exception of one written partially in Lua and C++ too, as the components required).
      </p>
      <p>Apart from programming, I like to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strum my guitar strings sometimes.</li>
        <li>Read books, and recently I've gotten into autobiographies</li>
        <li>Driving - I like driving, it's an essential skill, while being enjoyable, except when it comes to parking though.</li>
        <li>Mobile photography - There's just something about trying to get the maximum out of a phone camera, twiddling around with pro mode, adjusting ISO, shutter speed, to get different shots, or timelapse, or light painting effect.</li>
        <li>Stay upto date with all the news I scourge from HN, reddit, /g/, and um, some non googlable websites.</li>
        <li>Trying out new food to eat around the city, and cook some myself too. (MasterChef fan here.)</li>
        <li>Last but not the leas, and however much cliched it sounds: TRAVELLING! Only one of time and money ruins most of the plans I make every year, but yeah, I get around some place nice every year.</li>
      </ul>
