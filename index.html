<p>I'm a programmer by profession. I code website backends in Python, using Django.
I have 2 years of experience in that.
Apart from programming sites in Django, I am also fairly well experienced in
computer vision with OpenCV and Python.</p>

All the projects except for the last one, were client projects during my stay
at CodeMyMobile.</p>

<p>I love Python. Python is life, Python is love. This love story started in late 2011, when I for the first
time saw a guy open up his laptop's webcam programmatically with OpenCV and Python.
That was just... magic! I had seen Python code before that, but really hadn't seen why I'd
prefer it over C++ or Java.
Had it not been for the love I found for Python in 2011, I'd probably be bashing away some
Java madly at some stupid MNC. Thankfully, I'm not in that position, and I am very much grateful
that I write Python code daily to earn bucks.</p>
