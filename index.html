        <p>I'm a programmer by profession. I code website backends in Python, using Django.
          I've been programming backends in Python and Django mostly for companies since 2014. Besides that, I am fairly well experienced in computer vision with OpenCV and Python too. Game development forms the hobby part of my total time spent in programming.</p>

        <a id="my-works" class="anchor" href="#my-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My works:</h2>
        <p>I spent most of my time in <a href="http://www.codemymobile.com">CodeMyMobile</a>.
        All the projects except for the last one, were client projects during my stay
      at CodeMyMobile.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://bookwithbit.com">Bookwithbit</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://cosign.co">CoSign</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://publishers.cosign.co">CoSign for Publishers</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://friendlydealsapp.com">Friendly Deals</a></li>
        <li>ITSigma (client sold it, don't know where it's hosted now)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then in 2016 I joined Times Internet, under GetMeAShop - an e-commerce platform, an Indian counterpart to Shopify. There I contributed a lot to the core product, and 5 internal projects.</p>

      <a id="more-about-me" class="anchor" href="#more-about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More about me:</h2>
      <p>I love Python. Python is love, Python is life (in my programming universe). This love story started in late 2011, when I for the first
        time saw a guy open up his laptop's webcam programmatically with OpenCV and Python.
        That was just... magic! Well, that's the high level abstraction of things you can usually find in almost all Python libraries. I had seen Python code before that, but really hadn't seen why I'd
        prefer it over C++ or Java.
      Had it not been for the love I found for Python in 2011, I'd probably be developing Android apps in Java or doing backend development in Java at an MNC, which is cool too, except that it wasn't my cup of tea for development if a short product POC ETA is preferred or if I need to hack out an idea as fast as possible. For me, that's the beauty of Python - the minimal time to bring out an idea to life.</p>
      <p>
        In the future though, I'm planning out things to implement in Go lang, so that's an area I'd love to explore in future jobs or endeavours of mine. Currently out of the 8 projects that I've built myself for myself, 3 of which were to be businesses, are all written in Python (with the exception of one written partially in Lua and C++ too, as the components required).
      </p>
      <p>Apart from programming, I like to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Life hacks - studying and recognizing patterns in things in life, optimizing stuff, studying habits, studying the effects of small changes, stuff like that. I'm almost always finding ways to hack my living to make it better for me and others.</li>
        <li>Play my guitar sometimes. Yeah, I know a bunch of chords.</li>
        <li>Read books, and recently I've gotten into autobiographies.</li>
        <li>Driving - I like driving, it's an essential skill, while being enjoyable, except when it comes to parking and traffic though.</li>
        <li>Mobile photography - there's just something about trying to get the maximum out of a phone camera, twiddling around with pro mode, adjusting ISO, shutter speed, to get different shots, or timelapse, or light painting effect.</li>
        <li>Stay upto date with all the news I scourge from HN, reddit, /g/, and um, some non googlable websites.</li>
        <li>Trying out new food to eat around the city, and cook some myself too. (MasterChef fan here.)</li>
        <li>Last but not the least, and however cliched it may sound: TRAVELLING! Only either of time or money ruins most of the plans I make every year, but yeah, I get around to some place nice every year.</li>
        <li>YouTube - I love watching awesome interesting content. Planning to open a channel to put up some content on technology with a perspective that no one else currently presents. Need to polish the idea here a bit, and maybe in a couple of years I'll update here itself with a link to my channel.</li>
      </ul>
